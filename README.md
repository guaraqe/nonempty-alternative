# nonempty-alternative

Non-empty lists from `semigroups` can be naturally extended to an `Alternative` interface since it contains the `empty` element. Many instances arise naturally from this interface.

This generalization allows the use of non-empty `List`, `ZipList`, `Vector`, etc...

## TODO

- Check the if the instance laws are satisfied. I'm not sure about Monad and Applicative.
